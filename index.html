Here on campus, <br> My name is Shawn Gray and this is my first year as a student at Millersville Univeristy. My indented major as of right now is Computer Assisted Designed/Drafting Engineer and potiental a minor in something else. I like the scenary of the school mainly the lake as its a place I like to walk around. Things I do for fun around here is bowling and music. Infact I have attended a few enembles already here at the university. Overall the first semester has been good and I can't wait for whats next in store
</p>
<p>
	In this website, I have gathered a majority of the projects I have created during this semester of the class. Projects included in this website are Digital Photos, an Infograpic, and a Bookmark. Each page will talk about how I came up with the idea, why I went with those ideas and my thoughts on how it ended up in the end.
