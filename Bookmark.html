The Bookmark project intention was to make a bunch of bookmarks for a nearby elementary school. First, started with sketches of what we wanted to do then move onto rough drafts. After we finished our designed on Adobe Indesign, it was ready to go to begin the frst print process. First was to transfer the image to a metal plate using a press tech plate setter. Then put this piece of metal into a machine called an offset Lithography that uses a bunch of rollers, cylinders, water, and ink to transfer the image on the metal plate to paper in a mass bulk. Finally using a cutting board to cut them in proper size and now they are ready to go. Below is my process of making mine which I think came out kinda nice.
